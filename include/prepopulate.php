What made Yale so incredible was the people you went there with. And sure, you could see them for a fleeting moment on the frozen streets of New York City or Chicago or Boston. But why NOT see them on a giant ship in a warm sunny place where the only frozen thing you’ll find is a cocktail with an umbrella in it, served with a smile?…Without the distractions of traffic, service changes on the L, 5 ft snow berms, and constant unrelenting freaking non-stop SIRENS. AHHHH! GET ME OUT OF THIS CITY!

You deserve more. You deserve Feb Club Cruise.

Feb Club Cruise is organized by alums, for alums (and friends!). We’ll throw a Mory’s night! A last last chance dance! There will be cocktails! Cocktail receptions! Receptions! Panels! Events hosted by your very own classmates! Do you want to hold a special event with your group? Awesome, we’ll help you! Put down that globe, Atlas, the sea is calling.

And if that does not sate you (you fiend!) there will be **Cruise Stuff!** A free rock climbing wall; free restaurants; a free gym overlooking the wine-dark sea; a giant bungee trampoline (!); nine pools and whirlpools; stores full of diamonds; terrible broadway revues; a fully-functional spa (pedicures anyone?); an upper-deck running track; a grand dining room with a big chandelier (I’ll never let go, Jack); and more. A vibrant cornucopia of post-ironic normcore roleplaying opportunities. Look, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGAesl0zmVM' target='_blank'>this promotional video</a> was dubbed from VHS!",

In addition to what we have below, you should also expect to find meetups with Yalies who share your interests, unpretentious panels with people who have used their degrees to do unusual things, and time to lounge by the pool and soak in the hot tub.

**Friday, February 12, 2016** - Miami, FL; *boat departs at 4:30pm*
In the morning, fly into Miami International Airport (MIA) and transfer to the cruise port, or arrive the evening before to join local Feb Club events on Thursday evening. At 4:30 pm on Friday, Royal Caribbean’s Majesty of the Seas departs from Miami. Shortly after sail-away, we’ll get together for a welcome-aboard cocktail reception which will roll into a group dinner in the main dining room. Afterwards, opening night festivities and events!

**Saturday, February 13, 2016** - Cococay, Bahamas; *8am to 5pm*
Beach day! Our ship arrives at Royal Caribbean’s private island at 8am and departs at 5pm. We’ll claim a spot on the beach - lounge in the sun, enjoy your favorite book away from the winter, play dizzy bat and beach volleyball as your heart desires, enjoy a special edition of pub trivia from the comfort of your beach lounger. But make sure to slather on that sunscreen, because you don’t want to miss the evening’s events. Tonight is Majesty of the Seas’ formal night, and we’ll throw a **Mory’s Night** (cups and all!) in the main dining room. We’ll have an array of planned stuff to do, from poker and shuffleboard tournaments to something different like a storytelling event where an assortment of alumni present four-minute tableaus from their lives. Then, join us on our private dancefloor for... the Last Last Chance Dance. Yeah, we know.

**Sunday, February 14, 2016** - Nassau, Bahamas; *8am to 5pm*
Around Nassau town, we did roam. Freeform alumni shenanigans on the tax-sheltered streets of historic Nassau. Join your fellow alums for a set of panels in a nearby bar on land and hear from classmates doing interesting things. Tonight, come together in the main dining room and raise glasses in a few toasts. After dinner, an alumni farewell variety show - think the ‘Yale Show’ meets ‘Bees ‘n Cheer.’ We’ll end the show with closing ceremonies and prepare for the oncoming diaspora. Unplanned pool party. Huddle together before the fall.

**Monday, February 15, 2016** - Miami, FL; *ship arrives at 7am*
President’s Day! This morning, with rueful smiles and somber farewells, we depart our beloved ship for dry land. Disembarkation will begin around 10am. Transfer to the airport for a flight back home, or perhaps stay a bit to enjoy Miami. Bask in the knowledge that you’ve made history on the first Feb Club Cruise.",

Basically: the more people in your group, the more you save. For each person (“berth”) your group brings onboard the ship, your group will receive a ‘bounty’ of between $20 and $35. The bounty will be paid directly to the Group Leader at the beginning of the cruise and can be split up or used however you like. A leader from your group should email ‘support@febclubcruise.com’ with the name and a brief description of the group. Once approved, the Group Leader will be given a booking code to distribute to the group members. Each member of the group will need to use that code when they complete their full registration.

If you are a group leader and bring between five and nine people (including yourself), you collect a bounty per berth (including yourself) of $20. Groups of between 10 and 19 people (including the leader) collect a bounty of $30 per person. Over 20 people and the bounty increases to $35. Group leaders can receive a maximum of $1,000 from the discount program.

We reserve the right to confirm that you know the other registrants in your group. Any group not in the spirit of the cruise will lose their group discount benefits.",
